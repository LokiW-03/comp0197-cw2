## Implemented CNN+CAM

1. **ResNet50 with GradCAM++:**  
    - Pretrained ResNet50 with GradCAM++. See ```resnetcam.py```. Load finetuned model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wT_NrUo6PivRcT4vohPDvoGiLiWkPhD_/view?usp=drive_link). (File cam/saved_models/resnet50_pet_cam.pth is 90.3 MB; this is larger than GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB)


2. **EfficientNet with Score-CAM:**  
   - A pretrained EfficientNet model is also available. Follow the same procedure as above to load the fine-tuned model.  
   - Download it from [OneDrive](https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ucabz68_ucl_ac_uk/EVMx450VpAdMkzGzf_tiJAQBTjf0wQ4KQ_qKk3L69fcrfw?e=i0k0FC).
