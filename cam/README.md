## Implemented CNN+CAM

1. Pretrained ResNet50 with GradCAM++. See ```resnetcam.py```. Load finetuned model from [OneDrive](https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ucabc46_ucl_ac_uk/EZMmauGXWtJFsp4TA4bg6PIBywMx_-yoUfeFZmYi7PuRNQ?e=RrvgLM). (File cam/saved_models/resnet50_pet_cam.pth is 90.27 MB; this is larger than GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB)
