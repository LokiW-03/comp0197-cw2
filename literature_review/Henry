### Novel

1. Does refining the CAM-generated pseudo-labels improve segmentation performance?
2. How much can a small amount of strong annotation (e.g. one pixel or scribble per object) boost weakly-supervised segmentation?
3. How does the type of weak supervision signal (image-level labels vs. bounding boxes vs. scribbles vs. point clicks) influence segmentation results and annotation effort?
