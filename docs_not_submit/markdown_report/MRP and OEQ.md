**MRP**  

To what extent can CAM-based weakly-supervised semantic segmentation, trained solely on image-level labels from the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, approximate the performance of a fully supervised model, and what are the key factors (e.g., network architecture choices, CAM refinement techniques, hyperparameter settings) influencing its effectiveness, performance and limitations for this specific task? 

**OEQ**  

How does the type and potential combination of sparse weak annotations (specifically bounding boxes, simulated points, and simulated scribbles) influence the segmentation performance and learning characteristics of a weakly-supervised model trained on the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, compared to using only image-level labels or full pixel-level supervision?
